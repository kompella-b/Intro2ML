EECE 5644: Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition  
Project: Classical vs. Tiny Neural Models for Time-Series Forecasting  
A reproducible comparison of classical statistical methods (Naïve, Seasonal-Naïve, ETS, ARIMA/SARIMA) against a minimal single-layer LSTM on short seasonal time series.   
Using rigorous rolling-origin backtesting on canonical datasets (Airline Passengers, Melbourne Temperatures), we provide practical guidance on when tiny neural models justify their complexity versus when classical methods suffice in the small-data regime.
